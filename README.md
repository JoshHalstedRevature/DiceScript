Dice roll simulator

# Description

This project is a simple dice rolling application that rolls two dice with a user-specified number of sides. 

The user is prompted to choose the number of sides for the dice. Invalid input for the number of sides results in an error, and the user is asked to try again. After three attempts with invalid input, the program ends.

The user is asked if they would like to roll again. The user must respond with "yes", "Yes", "y", or "Y" if they would like to reroll. Any other input will be interpreted as a negative and will end the program.

If the user chooses to reroll, they are asked if they would like to select new dice with a different number of sides. The user must respond with "yes", "Yes", "y", or "Y" to choose a different set of dice. Any other input will be interpreted as a negative, resulting in a reroll of the previous two dice.
